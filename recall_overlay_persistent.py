"""Recall Overlay Persistent - Persistent window border + name tab for ALL saved windows.

Uses a full-screen Canvas.from_screen() for rendering (blocks_mouse=False).
Per-pill Canvas.from_rect() canvases with blocks_mouse=True handle clicks.
Click canvases are rebuilt only on save/forget/redraw — never on a timer.

A focus lock prevents the win_focus cascade that occurs after w.focus():
when a pill click explicitly focuses a window, subsequent focus events are
suppressed for a short window so the highlight doesn't bounce.
