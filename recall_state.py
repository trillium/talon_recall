Recall State - Shared state, Talon registration, and storage

This module is the foundation of the recall system. It owns:
- Module/Context registration and tag/list declarations
- Captures for saved_window_names and recall_command_name
- Persistent storage (saved_windows, archived_windows, load/save)
- The dynamic spoken-form list (update_window_list)
- Forbidden-name checking
- Two-step pending-input state
