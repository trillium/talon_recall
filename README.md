# Recall — Name Your Windows, Control Them by Voice

Recall lets you save specific windows and switch between them instantly by voice. Keeping track of which window has which conversation gets pretty hard mentally when you're juggling a lot of agent coding windows. Naming them is a lot easier and lets you interact with windows more naturally, with less mental friction.

Give a specific window a specific name — for example, I use "mary" for my massage therapy booking application (they both start with MA, it works for my brain). Whenever I want to discuss features related to that project, I just start my sentence with the name:

```
"recall assign mary"           → saves the focused window as "mary"
"mary"                         → switches to it instantly
"mary what is the status?"     → switches and types the question
"mary 1"                       → switches and presses the 1 key
"mary commit and push bravely" → switches, types, and presses Enter
```

## Branches

| Branch | Who it's for | What's included |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **`main`** | Talon users with [talonhub/community](https://github.com/talonhub/community) already installed | Just the recall plugin — relies on community for dictation, keys, formatting, etc. |
| **`standalone`** | New to Talon Voice, no existing setup | Everything bundled — recall plus all the community dependencies needed to get started from scratch |

If you already use Talon, use `main`. If you're new to Talon and want to try voice control with minimal setup, use `standalone`.

## Installation

Recall requires [Talon](https://talonvoice.com) with [talonhub/community](https://github.com/talonhub/community). If you don't have those yet, see the [Talon installation guide](https://talon.wiki/Resource%20Hub/Talon%20Installation/installation_guide/) or use the `standalone` branch which bundles everything.

Clone this repo into your Talon user directory:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
git clone https://github.com/trillium/talon-recall ~/.talon/user/recall

# Windows
git clone https://github.com/trillium/talon-recall "%APPDATA%\Talon\user\recall"
```

Talon will automatically load the package.

## Getting started

### Saving a window

Focus any window, then say:

```
"recall assign edgar"
```

This saves the window with the name "edgar". Pick short, distinctive names that are easy to say — names of people work well (edgar, velma, oscar).

### Switching to a window

Just say the name:

```
"edgar"
```

### Dictating into a window

Say the name followed by what you want to type:

```
"edgar hello world"
```

This switches to edgar's window and types "hello world".

### Pressing Enter

Recall uses **ender words** — a word you say at the end of a phrase to press Enter. The default ender word is **"bravely"**.

There are three ways to use it:

```
"bravely"                     → just presses Enter (in dictation/mixed mode)
"hello world bravely"         → types "hello world" then presses Enter
"edgar hello world bravely"   → switches to edgar, types, then presses Enter
```

The ender word is configurable — edit `dictation_ender.talon-list` to change it or add alternatives. The `$` end-of-utterance marker ensures the ender word is only recognized at the very end of what you say, so it won't interfere with normal dictation containing the word mid-sentence.

In command mode, you can also say `"slap"` to press Enter.

### Pressing a number key

Say the name followed by a number:

```
"edgar 1"
```

This switches to the window and presses the number key. Useful for selecting numbered options in CLI tools.

## All commands

### Core

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `"recall assign <name>"` | Save the focused window |
| `"<name>"` | Switch to a saved window |
| `"<name> <dictation>"` | Dictate text into a window |
| `"<name> <dictation> bravely"` | Dictate + press Enter |
| `"<name> bravely"` | Switch to window + press Enter |
| `"<name> <number>"` | Press a number key |
| `"bravely"` | Press Enter (dictation/mixed mode) |
| `"<dictation> bravely"` | Type + press Enter (dictation/mixed mode) |

### Focus and window switching

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `"focus <app>"` | Switch to a running application by name |
| `"focus last"` | Switch to the previously focused application |
| `"window next"` | Cycle to the next window of the current app |
| `"window last"` / `"window previous"` | Cycle to the previous window |
| `"running list"` | Show/hide a list of running applications |
| `"running close"` | Hide the running applications list |
| `"launch <app>"` | Launch an application by name |

### Aliases and naming

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `"recall alias <name> <alias>"` | Add an alternate name |
| `"recall unalias <name>"` | Remove an alias |
| `"recall rename <name> <new>"` | Change a window's name |
| `"recall promote <alias>"` | Make an alias the primary name |
| `"recall combine <a> <b>"` | Merge b as alias of a |

### Terminal restoration

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `"recall restore <name>"` | Relaunch a terminal at saved path |
| `"recall revive <name>"` | Restore a forgotten/archived terminal |

### Default commands

Recall can run a shell command automatically when restoring a terminal window. Commands are defined in `recall_commands.talon-list`:

```
list: user.recall_commands
-
yolo: yolo
yolo resume: yolo --resume
dev server: npm run dev
build: npm run build
```

The left side is the spoken name, the right side is the shell command. When restoring a window, Recall waits for the terminal to be ready (detects title change) before typing the command.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `"recall config <name> <command>"` | Set the default command for a window |
| `"recall config <name> clear"` | Remove the default command |
| `"recall edit commands"` | Open the commands list in your editor |

### Window lifecycle

When a saved window closes, Recall preserves the entry (name, path, aliases, command) with a cleared window ID. This means `recall restore` can relaunch it later without losing any configuration.

Forgetting a window moves it to an archive rather than deleting it permanently:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `"recall forget <name>"` | Archive a saved window |
| `"recall forget all"` | Archive everything |
| `"recall archive"` | Show archived window names |
| `"recall revive <name>"` | Restore an archived terminal |
| `"recall purge <name>"` | Permanently delete from archive |

### Overlays

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `"recall list"` | Flash name labels on all windows (5s) |
| `"recall help"` | Full-screen help panel with all windows, metadata, and commands |
| `"recall close"` | Dismiss any overlay (also Esc key) |

The **help panel** shows each saved window with:
- Status indicator (green = running, red = closed)
- Name and aliases
- App name
- Assigned command (in accent color)
- Terminal path or full execution command (`cd /path && command`)
- Complete command reference

## Terminal path tracking

Recall tracks working directories for terminal windows by parsing the window title (the `user@host: /path` pattern set by most shells). It also listens for title changes in real time, so the path stays current as you `cd` around — even if a program like Claude Code later overwrites the terminal title.

Supported terminals: gnome-terminal, mate-terminal, kitty, Alacritty, foot, xfce4-terminal, Terminator, Tilix.

## Customization

### Ender words

The word "bravely" triggers Enter after dictation. You can change it or add alternatives by editing `dictation_ender.talon-list`:

```
list: user.dictation_ender
-
bravely: bravely
boldly: boldly
```

With multiple enders defined, any of them will work at the end of a phrase. The word was chosen because it almost never appears at the end of naturally dictated text, so it won't trigger accidentally.

### Forbidden names

Some words can't be used as window names because they conflict with commands. Edit `forbidden_recall_names.talon-list` to add or remove reserved words.

## How it works

Recall saves window references (ID, app name, title, terminal path, aliases, default command) to `saved_windows.json` in the package directory. When you say a window's name, it finds the window by ID, focuses it, and updates the terminal path if applicable.

For terminals, Recall detects the working directory by parsing the window title (e.g., `user@host: /path`). A real-time title listener captures path changes as they happen, so the saved path stays accurate even when programs overwrite the terminal title.

When a window can't be found by ID, Recall attempts a re-match by app name and title/path before giving up. Closed windows keep their configuration so they can be restored later.

The `restore` command launches a new terminal at the saved path and optionally runs the configured default command once the shell is ready.
