"""Voice-alias jump to a specific herdr tab/pane.

Say an alias (e.g. "mayor", "firstmate", "edgar") to focus that agent's herdr tab
and bring the herdr host terminal to the front. Extends recall's "focus a thing
by name" idea to "focus a herdr tab", but is self-contained — it does NOT touch
recall's persistent overlay (which has a known focus bug), it just shells out to
the herdr CLI.

Targets are resolved DYNAMICALLY at command time (tab/pane ids change across
restarts): named agents focus by name; the firstmate/mayor tabs are nameless in
herdr, so they resolve by cwd to whatever pane currently holds them.
